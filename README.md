# Automated Scripted Shorts - AI Video Generation Workflow

## Overview ‚ú®

This comprehensive automation system creates 100% AI-generated short-form videos and automatically posts them to TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. The workflow leverages cutting-edge AI models including Google's V3 Fast video generation, OpenAI's GPT-4 for scripting, and ElevenLabs for voice synthesis to create engaging content without manual intervention.

üöÄ The system generates high-quality video clips with synchronized voiceovers, automatic captions, and professional editing - all at a fraction of traditional production costs. Videos are created with proper hooks, builds, and resolutions to maximize engagement across social platforms. The automation handles everything from script generation to final upload, making it possible to run a complete content farm with minimal oversight.

The workflow is dynamic and intelligent, automatically determining the optimal number of video clips needed based on script length and content requirements. Each video is uniquely generated with contextually appropriate visuals that match the narration, ensuring coherent and engaging content output.
